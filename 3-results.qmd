## No visual signs of biodegradation for recovered Ecovio\textregistered

Biodegradation of compostable plastic was assessed by closely inspecting the recovered materials using a magnifying glass after a 30-day incubation in lake and marine benthic conditions. Overall, compostable plastics remained unchanged compared to the pristine material for both benthic environments, they also conserved their original transparency and flexibility after they were thoroughly cleaned. Differences between Ecovio\textregistered\ and conventional filter-paper recovered materials can be observed in @fig-visual. The breakdown of cellulose was far more severe in lake compared to marine, indicating faster biodegradation in the former environment. Paper disks inside the freshwater reactors underwent a strong mineralization process evidenced by a blackish hue, brittleness and fragmentation of the material, some of which broke apart during recovery attemps. On the other hand, filter-paper recovered from the seawater environment was significantly more preserved and only displayed a faint brownish tint, which can be attributed to a relatively less active microbial community compared to freshwater.

Exceptionally, some individual samples from the freshwater environment showed minor signs of disintegration which might be due to biological degradation of the polymer. In line with the hypothesis suggested by @tosin2012, this unusual results may be explained by the presence of finely adapted mycelial organisms (i.e. fungi and actinomycetes) that are able to produce enzymes capable of breaking complex chemical bonds such as those found in lining. However, the infrequency of these results requires further research on the exact organisms and processes involved in the biodegradation of compostable materials in La Bre単a Reservoir.

## Ecovio\textregistered\ test revealed a negative response for every environment

BOD is generally used as a proxy for biodegradation of organic materials and allows fast testing of novel polymers (@beiras2023). Based on the principles described in @sec-methods-proxy, a quantitative evaluation of polymer mineralization was conducted. Generally, plastic tests remained close to the baseline established by negative control tests, while positive control tests ---those incubated with cellulose--- performed a fast BOD increase since the start of the incubation. In @tbl-bod the minimum, median, and maximum BOD after 30 days (BOD~30~) is represented. Marine tests varied over a narrower range compared to freshwater, which showed higher result heterogeneity, indicating a relatively more diverse microbial community in this environment. No significant difference was detected between plastic and control tests for lake (t-test, p-value = 0.72) and marine (t-test, p-value = 0.56) environments. A positive respirometrical response for positive control tests became evident after 10 days for the lake environment and 20 days for the marine environment, as illustrated in @fig-bod. Almost identical results where obtained by @tosin2012 for another EN 13432 certified compostable plastic. Whereas negative control and plastic tests stayed virtually the same throughout the whole testing period, indicating minimal biodegradation. This data correlates well with the visual appearance of the recovered materials, where almost no sign of plastic biodegradation was observed for both environments.

## Nonlinear models of higher complexity fit observed data more accurately

Ultimate biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) is typically estimated by fitting observed BOD data to a nonlinear model, which provides robust evidence for the biodegradability of polymers [@beiras2023]. Traditionally, a SEM based on a first-order decay equation has been employed to characterize BOD kinetics; however, this approach has been criticized for its limited accuracy in representing the complexity of real biodegradation processes [@hewitt1975]. The study aims to provide further evidence on the improved accuracy of double exponential model in fitting BOD curves [@mason2006]. @fig-fits illustrates the comparative performance of SEM and DEM in fitting biodegradation curves. The double exponential model demonstrates a closer resemblance to the empirical data compared to the single exponential model, as seen by the close fit of the curve to the observed data from a plastic-incubated sea reactor. This improved fit is quantitatively supported by a lower Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) value [@bozdogan1987], which is about 33% lower than that of the single exponential model, indicating higher model accuracy and a better representation of the underlying biodegradation processes.

Furthermore, the analysis highlights the complex nature of biodegradation kinetics, where a double exponential model effectively decomposes the BOD response into two distinct components: a labile fraction that degrades rapidly and a refractory fraction that degrades more slowly [@mason2006]. This approach captures the heterogeneity of environmental sample already containing organic matter. The model fitting results, summarized in Table 3.2, reveal that the ultimate BOD values vary between different materials and environments, with sea environments exhibiting lower BOD levels compared to lakes, reflecting differences in biodegradation potential. However, the modeling process encountered limitations, particularly in reactors incubated with cellulose. In these cases, parameter estimation failed, which is likely attributable to excessive organic matter loading which hampered model convergence. Overall, the results underscore the importance of employing advanced nonlinear models, such as the double exponential, to more accurately characterize biodegradation kinetics, particularly when dealing with heterogeneous organic substrates and complex biological interactions.
