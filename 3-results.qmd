## Visual signs of biodegradation for recovered materials

Overall, compostable plastics remained unchanged compared to the new material for both benthic environments, they also conserved their original transparency and flexibility after they were thoroughly cleaned. Differences between Ecovio\textregistered\ and conventional filter-paper recovered materials can be observed in @fig-visual. Cellulose broke down much more severely in lake than in the marine environment, suggesting that biodegradation occurs more quickly in the former. A blackish hue and brittleness were signs of a severe degradation process, some paper disks broke apart during recovery efforts. On the other hand, cellulose recovered from the seawater environment was significantly more preserved and only displayed a faint brownish tint, which can be attributed to a relatively less active microbial community compared to lake. Exceptionally, some individual Ecovio\textregistered\ disks recovered from the freshwater environment showed small holes which might be due to biological degradation of the polymer.

## BOD tests results

Generally, plastic tests remained close to the baseline established by negative control tests, while positive control tests performed a fast BOD increase since the start of the incubation. In @tbl-bod the minimum, median, and maximum BOD after 30 days (BOD~30~) is represented. Marine tests varied over a narrower range compared to lake, which showed higher heterogeneity between tests. A positive respirometrical response for positive control tests became evident after 10 days for the lake environment and 20 days for the marine environment, as illustrated in @fig-bod.

## Nonlinear model comparison and ultimate biodegradability

@fig-fits illustrates the comparative performance of SEM and DEM in fitting biodegradation curves. Fitted DEM adjusts more accurately to the trend underlying the data than SEM, as evidenced by the curve's near match to data points from a plastic-incubated marine reactor. @tbl-aic displays an AIC summary for both nonlinear models. DEM had a median 33.27% lower AIC than SEM, showing a significantly higher model accuracy and an improved representation of the underlying biodegradation processes, even though they were marginally less successful at convergence.

#| label: tbl-aic
#| tbl-cap: Performance metrics summary for fitted nonlinear models.

```

Ultimate BOD (BOD~L~) was estimated from the parameters of the best fitting model, as summarized in @tbl-bodl. The median BOD~L~ for Ecovio\textregistered\ and negative controls are nearly identical. The substantial difference between minimum and maximum BOD~L~ indicates high background test noise, highlighting the complexity of environmental field samples.
