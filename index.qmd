# Abstract {.unnumbered}

Plastic pollution represents an urgent concern within the context of global environmental challenges. Marine ecosystems are particularly sensitive to plastic, which tends to accumulate quickly due to environmental persistence. Macrofauna become trapped in plastic litter and suffocate as a result of accidental ingestion. Microplastics, on the other hand, have been shown to constitute an increasing toxicological and ecotoxicological danger, the implications of which are still widely unknown. The persistence of plastics in marine ecosystems is largely attributed to their resistance to biodegradation, a problem potentially addressed by replacing fossil-based plastics with novel, compostable polymers termed «bioplastics». This study utilized a 30-day biological oxygen demand (BOD) test to evaluate the biodegradation of Ecovio\textregistered\ ---a polylactid acid (PLA) and polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT) blend--- in simulated benthic environments, employing field water and sediment samples from La Breña Reservoir and Los Boliches Beach. The ultimate biodegradability was evaluated using a novel double exponential model (DEM), comparing its accuracy to a classic single exponential model (SEM). After visual inspection, the recovered materials were almost completely intact, and BOD tests confirmed a negative response to mineralization. This suggests that Ecovio\textregistered\ remains a persistent pollutant, highlighting the limitations of relying solely on biotechnological answers to address the global plastic crisis. Moreover, DEM outperformed conventional SEM in fitting BOD curves (33% lower Akaike Information Criterion value), illustrating the complex nature of biodegradation kinetics. While attractive, these synthetic alternatives may not be sufficient to tackle the escalating problem of irreversibly flooding the ocean in plastic.
