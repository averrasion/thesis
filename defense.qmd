# Introduction

## Plastic pollution outlook {.unnumbered}

- Ocean plastic flux: 11,000,000 Mt/y [@reddy2020]
- Poorly reversible impact [@macleod2021]
- Accelerating trend driven by "business as usual" [@oecd2022]

## Outside a safe operating space {.unnumbered}

::: incremental
- Defined 9 planetary boundaries [@rockstrom2009]
- 6/9 boundaries transgressed [@richardson2023]
- Out of bounds for plastic pollution --- production outpaces safety assessment [@persson2022]

> […] it remains a scientific challenge to assess how much loading of novel entities Earth system tolerates before irreversibly shifting into a potentially less habitable state.

## The main problem: environmental persistence {.unnumbered}

Plastic **is not biodegradable** and accumulates in the ocean:

- Plastic bags captured on video at 10,000 m deep [@jamieson2022]
- High abundance of microplastics in Arctic deep-sea sediment [@bergmann2017]

Engineered remediation is unlikely to succeed [@macleod2021]

### What are the consequences to marine life? {.unnumbered}

- 17% of entangled *spp.* are IUCN Red listed
- *Procellariiformes* highly vulnerable to poisoning
- Invasive species rafting

### Substituting plastic with novel polymers? {.unnumbered}

- Compostable, does not mean environmentally biodegradable.
- e.g. PLA needs 60 °C to effectively degrade

## Are 'bioplastics' environmentally safe? {.unnumbered}

::: incremental
- Depends on polymer composition and environment --- salinity, T, microbial diversity [@lott2021]
- Many **do not degrade** at sea, e.g. PLA [@royer2023]
- Lack of consensus around biodegradation test methods [@lavagnolo2024]
- Environmental research falls behind leaving a **knowledge gap** [@ribba2022]

## Objectives of the study {.unnumbered}

- Evaluate **Ecovio®** compostable plastic biodegradability
- Propose a **fast and environmentally relevant** test method for benthic environments [@tosin2012]
- Predicting ultimate biodegradability --- **new non-linear models** for BOD curves

## Field sampling

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(leaflet)

samples <- data.frame(
  lat = c(37.8320, 36.5479),
  lng = c(-5.0369, -4.6152), 
  popup = c("La Breña Reservoir", "Los Boliches Beach")
)

leaflet(samples) |> 
  addProviderTiles("Esri.WorldImagery") |> 
  addMarkers(~lng, ~lat, popup = ~popup) |> 
  setView(lat = 37, lng = -5, zoom = 6) |>
  addMiniMap() |> 
  addScaleBar()
```
