# Introduction {#sec-intro}

Plastic pollution has become a global concern attracting much attention from the environmental science community in recent years [@macleod2021]. The issue is particularly alarming in the context of the Global Ocean were an estimate annual flux of 11 million tons of plastic reach the ocean every year [@reddy2020]. Current predictions claim the problem will worsen as global chains of production and consumption develop at an accelerating rate driven by the «business as usual» economic model [@oecd2022]. In an attempt to establish sensible limits, @rockstrom2009 first defined nine planetary boundaries ensuring the integrity of Earth's capacity to self-regulate [@fig-pb]. It has later been submitted that the planetary boundary for plastic pollution is already transgressed, warning that plastic production outpaces the capacity for environmental safety assessment and monitoring [@persson2022]. Applying this framework, @villarrubia2018 emphasizes the ecological impact of marine plastic and its role in biodiversity loss, which is considered a core planetary boundary. The argument presented by @amigas2021 condemns current business practices based on greenwashing strategies designed to sustain profits in a linear economy, which is widely accepted as the root of the problem [@eu2025].

Overwhelming evidence proves that plastic polymers persist in the environment and tend to accumulate rapidly [@geyer2017] whereas engineered remediation strategies are unlikely to succeed in preventing poorly reversible damage [@macleod2021]. The ubiquity of plastic in the ocean is such that plastic bags have been captured on video as deep as 10,000 meters below sea level [@jamieson2022] and high quantities of microplastics have been characterized in the remoteness of arctic deep-sea sediment [@bergmann2017]. Plastic pollution has devastating consequences on marine biodiversity, in a review study @gall2015 found that 17% of marine species affected by entanglement and ingestion are listed on the IUCN Red List. Recent evidence suggests that some seabirds of the order *Procellariiformes* ---albatrosses and petrels--- are highly vulnerable to poisoning due to the olfactory trap of plastic fouling [@savoca2016]. Moreover, potentially invasive species disperse on top of plastic debris rafting across thousands of kilometers [@carlton2017]. In the context of a warming climate, tropical sessile species can more easily travel into template seas. Such is the case for the invasive barnacle *Elminius modestus*, reported colonizing plastic debris as far north as the Shetland Islands (60\textdegree N) in the Atlantic [@barnes2005]. Microplastics are of particular consideration due to their higher aquatic mobility and biological penetration, posing great challenges in determining their distribution [regitze2024]. They can adsorb heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants increasing their overall toxicity [@holmes2012; @rochman2013], moreover the additives they contain are a dangerous mixture of synthetic chemicals that cause acute mortality at low concentrations, such is the case of a rubber tire antioxidant reported to cause mass death in wild salmon [@tian2021].

A pressing need for immediate political action has lead to the recent prohibition of some single use plastic products at the same time corporate interest moves towards novel plastic polymers based on renewable feedstocks and are advertised as biodegradable under the umbrella term «bioplastic» [@eubp2025]. Despite their promising potential, commercially available bioplastics are only partially bio-based or exhibit incomplete biodegradability [@oceana2022], therefore current regulations focus on industrial composting where a threshold biodegradation percent is obtained under controlled conditions ---e.g. temperatures of 60 \textdegree C [@farah2016]--- which are rarely found in the natural environment. Pioneering field experiments have shown heterogeneous results concerning bioplastic potential biodegradability in the marine environment depending on polymer composition and environmental factors such as salinity, temperature and microbial diversity [@lott2021]. On the other hand, other studies focus on researching standardized laboratory methods to assess mineralization of novel synthetic polymers in the aquatic environment [@lopez2022; @miksch2022]. However, a review by @lavagnolo2024 found that there is a general lack of standardized practices for assessing the environmental safety of novel polymers at different environmental conditions. Following the previously mentioned outpace at which new blends of polymers flood the market, thorough environmental research falls behind leaving a gap of knowledge on the ultimate fate of bioplastics and their byproducts in the ocean [@ribba2022].

The aim of this study is to determine the ultimate fate of Ecovio\textregistered\ compostable plastic bags in the aquatic environment employing fast and replicable testing methods [@lopez2022]. The relevance of microbes living in the sediment was also investigated, as proposed in the pioneering work of @tosin2012, by simulating the open environment in the laboratory. In an attempt to bridge the gap in novel compostable plastics biodegradation under different environmental conditions [@lavagnolo2024], lake and marine benthic environments were studied using field samples from two popular beach locations in Andalusia, Spain. Plastic biodegradation is a process in which microbes convert all of its constituents to new microbial biomass, gases and minerals [@eu2021], this process may take years at environmentally relevant conditions [@pelegrini2016]. To provide relevant findings in a reasonable period of time, a highly sensitive test method based on biological oxygen demand (BOD) was adopted [@tosin2012]. In most cases, only 30 days were required to determine ultimate biodegradability by fitting nonlinear regression models, thanks to recent advancements in computing technology combined with open software [@padfield2025].

<!-- ## Plastic pollution at a planetary scale -->

<!-- To understand the threat plastic pollution poses to the ocean, we first need to approach the current environmental crisis from a planetary scale. In order to assess the risk, we need to consider the remarkably stable planetary conditions fo the Holocene epoch which compromised the past 10,000 years. It was during that time when human communities developed agriculture, civilization and eventual industrialization, made possible by the integrity of self-regulating Earth's system. Planetary stability is currently threatened by our global civilization based on capitalistic economic growth. This societal model has grown enough to disrupt biogeochemical processes at a global scale. -->

<!-- Plastic persist in the environment and consequently accumulate everywhere we look. @turner2020 studied Lego blocks washed up on the beach and estimated their residence time in the sea between hundreds to thousands of years. Abrasion, photo-oxidation and fouling can physically degrade plastic items into microscopic particles with increased biological penetrability and toxicity. @macleod2021 argued that engineered remediation strategies are unlikely to succeed in preventing irreversible damage, they stated that it remains a scientific challenge to quantify the damage of plastic due to the far reaching consequences of interactions with carbon and nutrient cycles, habitat disruption, ecotoxicity and social degradation. -->

<!-- ## Distribution and flux of plastic into the ocean -->

<!-- Despite recycling and waste collection efforts, the flux of plastics into rivers and seas is a worsening problem. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development issued a global report estimating that, only in 2019, 6 million tons (Mt) of mismanaged and littered plastic waste reached the aquatic environment [@oecd2022], contributing to the growing stock of 139 Mt of plastic in rivers and the ocean. Projections indicate that this trend will continue to increase as plastic waste generation accelerates worldwide, primarily driven by economic growth, considering that most plastic waste consists of packaging and other products with an intended lifespan of less than a year, exhibiting poor environmental logic. -->

<!-- Macroplastics are the most evidently pervasive of plastic debris in the ocean, they can be seen floating on the ocean surface and sinking to the sea floor. Photographic evidence shows plastic bags reaching as deep as the bottom of the Philippine Trench at 10,000 m below sea level [@jamieson2022]. In addition to littering of end-life plastic products, accidental spills of plastic at sea occur frequently, highlighting the case of the Toconao vessel, which lost 25 tones of pellets into the Atlantic reaching 1,498 km of coastline in Galicia, in December 2023 [@vidalabad2024]. Studies on macroplastic transport in the ocean provide evidence on their final accumulation zones, The density of the polymer and the surface area of macroplastics, combined with local environmental factors determine ultimate plastic accumulation zones, with less than 1% remaining buoyant on the surface [@schwarz2019]. As macroplastics in the photic layer of the ocean develop fouling and fragment due to polymer photo-oxidation, they become denser and tend to sink in deeper waters, eventually reaching the pelagic sediments. -->

<!-- Microplastics and nanoplastics are of particular consideration due to their higher aquatic mobility and posing great challenges in determining their distribution. Allochthonous sources of microplastics include fibers from synthetic textiles and fragments found in high concentrations in wastewater treatment plant discharge [@bayo2023], they can also reach the ocean through the atmosphere by aerosol deposition, as airborne particles originating from traffic-related sources, such as the abrasion of tires, brakes, and plastic-containing road materials [@sommer2018].  Recent evidence shows that microplastics not only reach the sea floor through vertical sinking but also travel horizontally across the abyssal plain carried along by deep thermohaline circulation, field measurements show high environmental concentrations of microplastics near biodiversity hot-spots in the pelagic domain [@kane2020]. -->
