# Introduction

Plastic pollution has become a global concern attracting much attention from the environmental science community in recent years [@macleod2021]. The issue is particularly alarming in the context of the Global Ocean were an estimate annual flux of 11 million tons of plastic reach the ocean every year [@reddy2020]. Current predictions claim the problem will worsen as global chains of production and consumption develop at an accelerating rate driven by the «business as usual» economic model [@oecd2022]. In an attempt to establish sensible limits, @rockstrom2009 first defined nine planetary boundaries ensuring the integrity of Earth's capacity to self-regulate, it has later been submitted that the planetary boundary for plastic pollution is already transgressed, warning that plastic production outpaces the capacity for environmental safety assessment and monitoring [@persson2022]. The argument made by @amigas2021 condemns current business practices based on greenwashing strategies intended to sustain profits in a linear economy, which is generally accepted as the root of the problem [@eu2025].

Overwhelming evidence proves that plastic polymers persist in the environment and tend to accumulate rapidly [@geyer2017] whereas engineered remediation strategies are unlikely to succeed in preventing poorly reversible damage [@macleod2021]. The ubiquity of plastic in the ocean is such that plastic bags have been captured on video as deep as 10,000 meters below sea level [@jamieson2022] and high quantities of microplastics have been characterized in the remoteness of arctic deep-sea sediment [@bergmann2017]. Plastic pollution has devastating consequences on marine biodiversity, in a review study @gall2015 found that 17% of marine species affected by entanglement and ingestion are listed on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List. Recent evidence suggests that some seabirds are highly vulnerable to poisoning due to the olfactory trap of plastic fouling [@savoca2016] while potentially invasive species disperse on top of plastic debris rafting across thousands of kilometers [@carlton2017]. Additionally, smaller plastic particles can adsorb heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants increasing their overall toxicity [@holmes2012; @rochman2013], moreover the additives they contain are a dangerous mixture of synthetic chemicals that cause acute mortality at low concentrations, such is the case of a rubber tire antioxidant reported to cause mass death in wild salmon [@tian2021].

A pressing need for immediate political action has lead to the recent prohibition of some single use plastic products at the same time corporate interest moves towards novel plastic polymers based on renewable feedstocks and are advertised as biodegradable under the umbrella term *bioplastic* [@eubp2025]. Despite their promising potential, commercially available bioplastics are only partially bio-based or exhibit incomplete biodegradability [@oceana2022], therefore current regulations focus on industrial composting where a threshold biodegradation percent is obtained under controlled conditions including temperatures as high as 60 °C [@farah2016], which are rarely found in the natural environment. Pioneering field experiments have shown heterogeneous results concerning bioplastic potential biodegradability in the marine environment, depending on variables such as climate, microbial diversity, and type of polymer [@lott2021] while other studies focus on researching standardized laboratory methods to assess novel synthetic polymers in the aquatic environment [@lopez2022; @miksch2022]. Following the previously mentioned outpace at which new blends of polymers flood the market, thorough environmental research falls behind leaving a gap of knowledge on the ultimate fate of bioplastics [@ribba2022].

The aim of this study is to assess the ultimate fate of commercial compostable plastic bags in the aquatic environment, the relevance of microbes living in the sediment was investigated as proposed in the pioneering work of @tosin2012 by recreating the benthic habitat (e.g. the seafloor) in the laboratory. According to the need of comparing and characterizing fresh and salt water environments [@lavagnolo2024], a experimental approach was developed involving both lake and sea environmental samples from popular beach places in Andalusia, Spain. Plastic biodegradation is a process in which microbes convert all of its constituents to new microbial biomass, gases and minerals [@eu2021], this process may take years at environmentally relevant conditions [@pelegrini2016]. In order to save precious time, a highly sensitive respirometric method was adopted [@tosin2012], only 30 days were needed in most cases to determine ultimate biodegradability by fitting non linear regression models thanks to recent advancements in computing technology and open software [@padfield2025].

<!-- The assessment study presented in this thesis aims to provide further evidence into effectively addressing the global challenge of plastic production and their impact in marine ecosystems, focusing on the environmental degradability of commercial compostable plastics. Following the previously provided evidence, under the assumption that these materials are equally like of being mismanaged and littered as conventional plastics, persistency of bioplastics. The comparison of sea and lake water is intended to provide a holistic approach to the heterogeneous environmental conditions of the aquatic environment, which determine the ultimate biodegradability of the studied material. -->

<!-- ## Plastic pollution at a planetary scale -->

<!-- To understand the threat plastic pollution poses to the ocean, we first need to approach the current environmental crisis from a planetary scale. In order to assess the risk, we need to consider the remarkably stable planetary conditions fo the Holocene epoch which compromised the past 10,000 years. It was during that time when human communities developed agriculture, civilization and eventual industrialization, made possible by the integrity of self-regulating Earth's system. Planetary stability is currently threatened by our global civilization based on capitalistic economic growth. This societal model has grown enough to disrupt biogeochemical processes at a global scale. -->

<!-- When @rockstrom2009 proposed a safe operating space for humanity, they argued that disruptions induced by biodiversity loss, climate change, nutrient cycle overloading and chemical pollution, might reach beyond a certain threshold. This boundary trespassing would irreversibly shift the environmental conditions of the Holocene into a less habitable state. @richardson2023 recently evidenced that six out of nine of these planetary boundaries are already transgressed, including the boundary for plastic waste. We cannot speak of a safe operating space for novel entities like plastic, @persson2022 submitted that plastics are the of highest concern since production and wasting outpace the capacity for environmental assessment and monitoring. -->

<!-- Plastic persist in the environment and consequently accumulate everywhere we look. @turner2020 studied Lego blocks washed up on the beach and estimated their residence time in the sea between hundreds to thousands of years. Abrasion, photo-oxidation and fouling can physically degrade plastic items into microscopic particles with increased biological penetrability and toxicity. @macleod2021 argued that engineered remediation strategies are unlikely to succeed in preventing irreversible damage, they stated that it remains a scientific challenge to quantify the damage of plastic due to the far reaching consequences of interactions with carbon and nutrient cycles, habitat disruption, ecotoxicity and social degradation. -->

<!-- ## Distribution and flux of plastic into the ocean -->

<!-- Despite recycling and waste collection efforts, the flux of plastics into rivers and seas is a worsening problem. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development issued a global report estimating that, only in 2019, 6 million tons (Mt) of mismanaged and littered plastic waste reached the aquatic environment [@oecd2022], contributing to the growing stock of 139 Mt of plastic in rivers and the ocean. Projections indicate that this trend will continue to increase as plastic waste generation accelerates worldwide, primarily driven by economic growth, considering that most plastic waste consists of packaging and other products with an intended lifespan of less than a year, exhibiting poor environmental logic. -->

<!-- Macroplastics are the most evidently pervasive of plastic debris in the ocean, they can be seen floating on the ocean surface and sinking to the sea floor. Photographic evidence shows plastic bags reaching as deep as the bottom of the Philippine Trench at 10,000 m below sea level [@jamieson2022]. In addition to littering of end-life plastic products, accidental spills of plastic at sea occur frequently, highlighting the case of the Toconao vessel, which lost 25 tones of pellets into the Atlantic reaching 1,498 km of coastline in Galicia, in December 2023 [@vidalabad2024]. Studies on macroplastic transport in the ocean provide evidence on their final accumulation zones, The density of the polymer and the surface area of macroplastics, combined with local environmental factors determine ultimate plastic accumulation zones, with less than 1% remaining buoyant on the surface [@schwarz2019]. As macroplastics in the photic layer of the ocean develop fouling and fragment due to polymer photo-oxidation, they become denser and tend to sink in deeper waters, eventually reaching the pelagic sediments. -->

<!-- Microplastics and nanoplastics are of particular consideration due to their higher aquatic mobility and posing great challenges in determining their distribution. Allochthonous sources of microplastics include fibers from synthetic textiles and fragments found in high concentrations in wastewater treatment plant discharge [@bayo2023], they can also reach the ocean through the atmosphere by aerosol deposition, as airborne particles originating from traffic-related sources, such as the abrasion of tires, brakes, and plastic-containing road materials [@sommer2018]. The authigenic microplastics in the ocean originate in the physical degradation by wave action and oxidative photo-degradation of macroplastics [@turner2020]. Their ubiquity has reached the point where high quantities of microplastics have been characterized in the remote Arctic deep-sea sediments [@bergmann2017]. Recent evidence shows that microplastics not only reach the sea floor through vertical sinking but also travel horizontally across the abyssal plain carried along by deep thermohaline circulation, field measurements show high environmental concentrations of microplastics near biodiversity hot-spots in the pelagic domain [@kane2020]. -->

<!-- ## Impact of plastic pollution on marine biodiversity -->

<!-- The first reported cases of macroplastic debris harming biodiversity involved sightings of megafauna entangled in plastic. Affected species include marine mammals such as seals and sea lions, seabirds and all known species of sea turtles. These animals have their movement impaired, suffocate and eventual death. A review study found that at least 17% of species affected by entanglement and ingestion are listed on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List [@gall2015]. Plastic ingestion has been reported across diverse marine biota with some species consuming enough plastic to threaten entire populations [@kuhn2020], it was recently demonstrated that seabirds of the order Procellariiformes (e.g. albatrosses and petrels) are particularly vulnerable to consuming plastic due to their high olfactory sensitivity which makes them attracted to the seasoning of marine waste [@savoca2016]. The drift of floating plastic debris has also raised concerns about the transoceanic rafting of potentially invasive species. The longest recorded rafting event occurred in the Pacific after a tsunami in Japan, where floating plastics facilitated species dispersal [@carlton2017]. In the context of a warming climate, tropical sessile species can more easily travel into template seas. For example, the invasive barnacle Elminius modestus has been reported colonizing plastic debris as far north as the Shetland Islands (60ºN) in the Atlantic [@barnes2005]. -->

<!-- Recently, research has focused on micro- and nanoplastics due to their ubiquity and potential (eco)toxicological effects. Particles smaller than 1 mm in diameter are easily ingested by fish and other marine species, the study form @holmes2012 show that heavy metals and persistent sorb onto plastic particles, increasing their toxicity, the same is true for organic pollutants [@rochman2013-sorption]. Upon ingestion by fish, experimental evidence shows they cause liver damage [@rochman2013-ingested]. Benthic organisms are also affected, microplastics can bioaccumulate in their tissues and cause oxidative stress, as seen in the sea cucumber *Holoturia tubulosa* [@cocci2025]. Moreover, plastic additives can cause acute toxicity in high-trophic-level species such as wild coho salmon, a study demonstrated a rubber antioxidant found in tire ware particles was responsible of massive deaths of coho salmon when migrating upriver [@tian2021]. -->

<!-- ## Bioplastics as a solution to marine persistency -->

<!-- Biodegradable and bio-based polymers have been proposed as alternatives to conventional plastics, particularly as a substitute for single-use packaging, which often has one of the shortest product lifespans [@geyer2017]. Given the increasing concerns over plastic pollution in marine environments, bioplastics have emerged as a potential solution to mitigate the environmental impact of persistent plastic waste. The term bioplastic encompasses a broad category of synthetic polymers derived from biomass and renewable resources which can serve as a carbon source for bacteria and other decomposers. However, the classification of bioplastics remains complex, as some polymers are only partially bio-based or exhibit incomplete biodegradability, resulting in a spectrum of materials with varying environmental fates and properties [@tokiwa2009]. -->

<!-- Despite their promising potential, bioplastics must be rigorously evaluated for their overall environmental safety before they can be considered a viable alternative to conventional plastics. As discussed within the planetary boundaries framework outlined earlier, the mere bio-based origin of a material does not guarantee its harmlessness to ecosystems, particularly in marine environments where degradation conditions differ significantly from those in controlled composting facilities. The current regulatory framework for biodegradable plastics primarily focuses on standardized industrial composting conditions, which define biodegradability based on at least 90% degradation under high-temperature conditions, typically around 60°C [@farah2016]. However, these conditions are rarely, if ever, found in marine environments, where temperatures are much lower, microbial communities differ, and degradation occurs at a much slower rate. This discrepancy raises concerns about the actual environmental performance of bioplastics [@lott2021]. -->
