Biodegradable and renewable-based polymers have been proposed as alternatives to conventional plastics, particularly as a substitute for single-use packaging, which often has one of the shortest product lifespans [@geyer2017]. The tests conducted in this study demonstrated that Ecovio\textregistered\ compostable plastic bags lack a rapid biodegradability in lake and marine benthic environments, posing a significant risk of persistence and bio-microplastic formation whose ecotoxicological potential remains widely unknown [@romera2022; @ribba2022]. This threat is especially alarming in marine ecosystems, where biodiversity loss is a major global concern in the context of a warming climate and an acidifying ocean [@villarrubia2018]. The increasing rate at which novel polymers marketed as «compostable» or, even worse, as «biodegradable» enter the market necessitates a critical evaluation of their environmental safety [@persson2022]. Consumers are frequently misled by certifications such as EN 13432, which only apply to performance within industrial composting facilities [@eubp2023]. This problem is exacerbated by greenwashing business practices, as they profit from widespread misinformation and consumer demand for sustainable products [@goel2021; @amigas2021]. As a recent example Amazon was caught selling plastic products claiming they were biodegradable, an inherently misleading claim that failed to meet international biodegradability standards, so a lawsuit was filed by 23 countries against Amazon, and the company agreed to pay $1.5 million to the California Consumer Protection Suit [@fusek2018].

The findings of this study are consistent with those reviewed by @lavagnolo2024, indicating that both PLA and PBAT have low biodegradability potential in the marine environment. PLA, in particular, is a popular biobased plastic notoriously resistant to degradation outside of carefully controlled industrial settings and strong evidence suggests it is as persistent as conventional plastic in the marine environment [@royer2023]. Furthermore, the findings of this study provide novel evidence on PBAT ---a petroleum-based polymer--- lack of biodegradability in lake freshwater, filling the gap in the review by @lavagnolo2024. However the results from the lake test were not altogether conclusive due to the occasional appearance of visibly perforated Ecovio\textregistered\ films, which might be linked to the action of mycelial organisms like fungi as proposed by @tosin2012. In addition, the lack of biodegradation suggests that Ecovio\textregistered\ products would inevitably fragment in the marine environment into increasingly smaller bio-microplastics, presenting similar threats to marine organisms as conventional plastics [@romera2022]. Studies have shown that these particles can disrupt nitrogen cycling in freshwater sediments [@seeley2020], cause lethal-toxicity up to 60% mortality in *Daphnia magna* [@zimmermann2020], induce anxiety-like behavior and impaired movement in *Danio reiro* fish larvae [@oliveira2021], and recude fertility rate in *Microcosmus exasperatus* tunicate [@anderson2021].

Secondly, there are numerous factors that might influence observed BOD curves, including organic matter concentration, salinity, enzymatic inhibitors, nitrogen and phosphorus availability, and microbial diversity [@siwiec2011]. Recent advances in computing technology, together with the broader availability of open source programming solutions [@kuhn2023], enable for easier than ever usage of complicated nonlinear models for a wide variety of purposes, including BOD biodegradation curves. DEM outperformed SEM at fitting 30-day BOD curves for recreated benthic environments using AIC as a performance metric. DEM was able to capture the observed initial rapid BOD rise followed by a slower, more gradual increase. This was also the case for wastewater as evidenced by @mason2006. However, the predictions of such models are to be carefully examined, and ultimate BOD measures should not be used to replace empirical evidence from longer-term tests [@hewitt1979]. It is critical to recognize limitations, particularly those encountered while modeling the cellulose lake tests, whose BOD response was too steep to be evaluated within 30 days. A lower material load is recommended in order to avoid excessive responses. It is reasonable to believe, however, that adding another exponential term to the model would better suit an even more complex organic substrate. Consequently, future research should explore the goodness-of-fit of triple exponential models to BOD curves of longer testing periods.
