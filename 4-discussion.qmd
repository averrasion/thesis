The increasing promotion of «compostable» plastics like Ecovio\textregistered \ --made by blending PLA and PBAT--- represents a complex and, arguably, misplaced strategy in tackling plastic pollution [@amigas2021]. The European Standard EN 13432, which certifies Ecovio’s compostability, defines a specific performance benchmark inside industrial composting facilities [@eubp2023]. However, this standard necessitates high temperatures up to 60 \textdegree C, controlled humidity, and a intentionally designed microbial community [@farah2016]. These conditions extraordinarily rare, if not entirely absent, in natural environments such as rivers, lakes or oceans [@oceana2022]. The results of this study coincide with those reviewed by @lavagnolo2024, indicating the lack of biodegradability potential of both PLA and PBAT in the marine environment. PLA, in particular, is notoriously resistant to degradation outside of carefully 
controlled industrial settings [@royer2023]. Additionally, novel evidence is provided on the non-renewable polymer PBAT possible lack of biodegradation in lake freshwater. However the results from the lake test were not altogether conclusive due to methodological dificulties and the occasional appearance of visibly perforated Ecovio\textregistered \ films, which might be linked to the action of mycelial organisms like fungi as proposed by @tosin2012.

Furthermore, the EN 13432 compostable certification, rather than representing a genuine solution to plastic pollution in the ocean, increasingly appears as a sophisticated marketing tool, capitalizing on consumer demand for sustainable products while obfuscating the fundamental problem of environmental persistency @macleod2021. In addition, the fragmentation of Ecovio\textregistered \ products into increasingly smaller «bio»microplastics present novel eco-toxicological effects on marine ecosystems that remain poorly understood. Studies have shown that these particles can accumulate in marine organisms, disrupting feeding behaviors, impairing reproductive success, and transferring throughout the food web [@ribba2022; @romera2022].

Recent advances in computing technology, together with the broader availability of open source programming solutions, enable for easier than ever usage of complicated nonlinear models for a wide variety of purposes [@kuhn2023]. The findings of this study support the application of DEM to analyze biodegradation kinetics, offering a significant improvement over traditional approaches based on a first-order decay equation [hewitt1975]. The robust performance of the DEM model, evidenced by a 33% lower Akaike Information 
Criterion (AIC) value compared to the SEM, represents a critical advancement in our understanding of biodegradation processes, indicating a substantial improvement in model predictive power [@mason2006]. DEM was able to capture the observed initial rapid BOD rise followed by a slower, more gradual increase. It's important to acknowledge limitations, particularly those encountered while modelling cellulose test, whose response was too sharp to be evaluated within 30 days, a lower material count is recommended in order to avoid unwanted exaggerated responses.

<!-- Despite their promising potential, bioplastics must be rigorously evaluated for their overall environmental safety before they can be considered a viable alternative to conventional plastics. As discussed within the planetary boundaries framework outlined earlier, the mere bio-based origin of a material does not guarantee its harmlessness to ecosystems, particularly in marine environments where degradation conditions differ significantly from those in controlled composting facilities. The current regulatory framework for biodegradable plastics primarily focuses on standardized industrial composting conditions, which define biodegradability based on at least 90% degradation under high-temperature conditions, typically around 60°C [@farah2016]. However, these conditions are rarely, if ever, found in marine environments, where temperatures are much lower, microbial communities differ, and degradation occurs at a much slower rate. This discrepancy raises concerns about the actual environmental performance of bioplastics [@lott2021]. -->

<!-- Biodegradable and bio-based polymers have been proposed as alternatives to conventional plastics, particularly as a substitute for single-use packaging, which often has one of the shortest product lifespans [@geyer2017]. Given the increasing concerns over plastic pollution in marine environments, bioplastics have emerged as a potential solution to mitigate the environmental impact of persistent plastic waste. The term bioplastic encompasses a broad category of synthetic polymers derived from biomass and renewable resources which can serve as a carbon source for bacteria and other decomposers. However, the classification of bioplastics remains complex, as some polymers are only partially bio-based or exhibit incomplete biodegradability, resulting in a spectrum of materials with varying environmental fates and properties [@tokiwa2009]. -->

<!-- Following the previously provided evidence, under the assumption that these materials are equally like of being mismanaged and littered as conventional plastics, persistency of bioplastics. -->
