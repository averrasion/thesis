## Ecovio\textregistered \ is a persistent pollutant in the marine environment

The increasing promotion of «compostable» plastics like Ecovio\textregistered \ --consisting of a PLA and PBAT polymer blend--- represents a complex and, arguably, misplaced strategy in tackling plastic pollution [@amigas2021; @oceana2022]. The European Standard EN 13432, which certifies Ecovio’s compostability, defines a specific performance benchmark inside industrial composting facilities [@eubp2023]. However, this standard necessitates high temperatures, controlled humidity, and a designed microbial community---conditions rarely, if ever, found naturally in rivers, lakes, or oceans. The results of this study coincide with those reviewed by @lavagnolo2024, indicating the lack of biodegradability potential of both PLA and PBAT in the marine environment. Consequently, the EN 13432 certification essentially becomes a marketing tool, failing to adequately address the fragmentation of Ecovio\textregistered \ products into «bio»-microplastics. These persistent particles present novel eco-toxicological effects on marine ecosystems that remain poorly understood, in addition to the same hazards posed by conventional plastics derived from fossil fuels [@ribba2022].
