## Biological oxygen demand as a proxy for biodegradation {#sec-methods-proxy}

Plastic biodegradation, sometimes also referred to as mineralization, is a complex biochemical process that converts polymer organic constituents into new microbial biomass and inorganic matter through microbial activity [@eu2021]. Here, aerobic biodegradation is considered, which implies the production of carbon dioxide (CO~2~) in the presence of oxygen gas (O~2~) following the process:

$$
\ce{Plastic + O2(g) ->[Microbes] Biomass + CO2(g) + Minerals}
$$

Consequently, the biodegradation process is measurable by analyzing the amount of O~2~ consumed or, inversely, the amount of CO~2~ produced. The test is designed to trap the produced CO~2~ as an insoluble precipitate inside a strongly alkaline solution of NaOH following the reaction:

$$
\ce{CO2(aq) + 2Na^+(aq) + 2OH^- + H2O -> Na2CO3(solid) + 2H2O}
$$

Therefore, pressure inside the reactor falls due to the sequestration of CO~2~ and biological oxygen demand (BOD) can be calculated from the observed pressure difference. According to the law of ideal gases, air pressure inside a rigid container only varies by two factors: variations in the number of gas molecules (i.e. oxygen consumption) and temperature [@tenny2025]. To accurately assess biodegradation the effect of temperature must be subtracted, this was accomplished by adjusting test data using the average pressure variation inside empty reactors where no biochemical reaction took place. The adjustment was defined by @eq-adj where $\Delta{}p_{O_2}$ is the pressure variation due to oxygen consumption, $\Delta{}p$ is the measured pressure variation inside the test reactors, and $\Delta{}\overline{p}_{0}$ is the average measured inside empty reactors.

$$
\Delta{}p_{O_2} = \Delta{}p - \Delta{}\overline{p}_{0}
$$ {#eq-adj}

BOD was then calculated under controlled testing conditions including oxygen gas molecular weight $M_{O_2}$ (mg O~2~ mol^-1^), ideal gas constant R (L hPa mol^-1^ K^-1^), incubation temperature $T$ (K), reference temperature $T_0$ at 273.15 K (0 \textdegree C), Bunsen absorption coefficient $\alpha$, total volume of the vessel $V_t$ (mL), and the volume occupied by the two-phased medium $V_m$ (mL); by following @eq-bod from the OxiTop\textregistered \ Control operating manual [@wtw2006]. <!-- According to , @eq-bod directeasily computed applying controlled testing conditions including oxygen gas molecular weight $M_{O_2}$ (mg O~2~ mol^-1^), ideal gas constant R (L hPa mol^-1^ K^-1^), incubation temperature $T$ (K),  reference temperature $T_0$ at 273.15 K (0 \textdegree C), Bunsen absorption coefficient $\alpha$, total volume of the vessel $V_t$ (mL) and the volume occupied by the two-phased medium $V_m$ (mL). -->

$$
BOD=\frac{M_{O_2}}{RT}\left(\frac{V_t-V_m}{V_m}+\alpha\frac{T}{T_0}\right)\Delta{}p_{O_2}
$$ {#eq-bod}

Biological oxygen demand (BOD) is a widely used parameter in the quantification of biodegradation because it enables rapid assessment of microbial activity during the process [@lavagnolo2024]. The present study evaluates compostable plastic biodegradation after 30 days of exposure to a simulated environment by incubating the material in a reactor medium already pre-exposed to environmental conditions. Some authors consider the effects of biodegradation by evaluating polymer tensile properties [@tosin2012]. This approach requires extensive incubation for long periods of time (@tosin2012 tested up to 24 months), the present methodology saves time by only evaluating the biochemical effects of biodegradation through oxygen consumption [@beiras2023].

The test medium recreated the natural environment on the submerged sediment at the near beach zone inside a sealed reactor. The two-phase approach (sediment and water column) was suggested by @tosin2012 in an attempt to simulate the conditions of a plastic item that has sunk to the bottom of the sea floor. Conversely, this study uses field samples instead of creating a synthetic aqueous solution. The reason for this adaptation is to accurately resemble the open environment while maintaining simplicity. In this study, reactors consisted of 1 L glass vessels sealed using the OxiTop\textregistered \ Control system. The head of the measuring device is equipped with a highly sensitive pressure gauge capable of measuring the pressure evolution inside the reactor. A cup holds a strongly alkaline solution of NaOH in contact with the aerial phase to trap the CO~2~ produced by microbial activity. Testing materials were placed on the sediment bed using a pair of tweezers, and bioplastic films were rigorously cleared of bubbles adhering to the surface to prevent the specimen from rising afloat.

<!-- @eq-bod-simple is a particularized version of the previous equation derived by computing a new empirical constant $K$ using experimentally set parameters ($K$ = 3.692927 mg O~2~ L^-1^ hPa^-1^). This allowed for a constant proportion between the adjusted pressure variation and BOD. -->

## Ecovio\textregistered \ compostable plastic bags as testing material

Compostable plastic bags were provided by @deiss2025 in the context of the @soplas2024, the material is commercially available under Ecovio\textregistered \ trademark name [@basf2025] and is made by blending PLA and PBAT polymers at variable proportions. PLA is synthesized from renewable feedstocks such as corn and sugar cane while PBAT has a nonrenewable fossil origin, resulting in a 50% renewable-based material with certified compostability under the European standard EN 13432 [@eubp2023]. Laboratory-grade filter paper was used as positive control test material as suggested by @tosin2012, paper consists of cellulose which is a commonly occurring polymer known to be biodegradable in all kinds of aerobic environments including freshwater and saltwater [@nagamine2022]. The purpose of testing paper is to compare the measured respirometrical response of a known biodegradable material with that of the compostable plastic subject to the assessment as proposed in a recent study by @beiras2023 which demonstrated that compostable plastic bags show similar rates of biodegradation disregarding the degree of grinding. In this study, 20 µm thick plastic films were cut into 20 mm diameter disk shapes, representing a standardized testing unit that is simple to duplicate. The same process was used with a filter paper sheet, also based in the claim made by @beiras2023 that film sheets perform equally than micronized materials. Sterilized tweezers were employed for manipulation with the aim to avoid the samples from becoming contaminated with room microbes.

## Lake and marine eulittoral zone field sampling

Sediment and water samples were collected from 2 beaches of both freshwater and seawater environments in Andalusia, Spain. Sampled beaches are recognized under Blue Flag certification by the Foundation for Environmental Education [@adeac2024]. The focus of the study is to assess potential biodegradation in beaches under pressure from plastic pollution therefore the Blue Flag offers a criteria for high occupation indicating a plastic littering hotspot. Firstly, La Breña Reservoir is a freshwater body located in Almodóvar del Río, Córdoba (37\textdegree 49'55.20''N, 5\textdegree 2'12.84''W) which offers a paramount depositional environment. Freshwater and sediment collection was done close to the shore at a water depth of 1 m to ensure the microbial community living in the sediment is fully adapted to submerged conditions. Secondly, Los Boliches Beach is located at the Mediterranean coast of Fuengirola, Málaga (30\textdegree 32'52.44''N, 4\textdegree 36'54.72''W) which is highly urbanized and dedicated to tourism. Sampling was conducted at further distance to the shore at 2 m depth during mid-tide targeting the suborbital zone.

## Laboratory test design and procedure

Preliminary tests were conducted before ultimate incubation to guarantee satisfactory results. Plastic testing units went through a sinking test to confirm films would remain deposited on the sediment bed, a polymer density higher than 1 g cm^-3^ results in negative buoyancy however small air bubbles adhering to the surface of the plastic made it difficult to sink, to solve the issue thorough clearing was applied using fine tweezers. Additionally, a 15-day pilot incubation was attempted to estimate the number of disks needed for a significant respiromentical response, 6 disks per reactor was the optimal amount. Once preliminary results were discussed a mature experiment could be designed. The assessment included 3 incubation treatments for both freshwater and saltwater, reactors either contained compostable plastic, filter paper or no polymer, the former being the control for positive mineralization response and the latter the negative control where no response is expected. Tests were replicated into 4 separate reactors resulting in a total size of 24 reactors which was large enough to minimize noise after applying statistical methods. Moreover 6 empty reactors were simultaneously incubated to calibrate our measurements and obtain standardized results.

Initially, 100 g of moist sediment were placed inside empty vessels followed by 200 mL of water from the corresponding sample. Marks were taken at the fill level to measure the volume later on. Fine particles from the lake sediment were slightly problematic as they tend to resuspended after pouring rising turbidity, the equilibrium was reached after a brief period of stillness. At that point, testing materials could be deposited on the sediment floor. The films were distributed evenly using a pair of long tweezers, avoiding overlapping to maximize contact area with the surrounding medium. Meanwhile, a 1 mol L^-1^ sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution was prepared from solid pellets, then each cup was filled with 50 mL. OxiTop\textregistered \ gauges were checked for sufficient battery life beforehand, they were also calibrated by a pneumatic test following the instructions provided by the manufacturer [@wtw2006]. Once the lids were ready, reactors were individually closed using 4 metal clips equidistantly arranged, adding a fine layer of grease at the border tire for extra sealing. Finally, pressure gauges were tightly screwed on top, then reactors were randomly placed inside the incubator chamber. Extreme care was taken to avoid the strongly alkaline solution from spilling onto the medium which would kill the microorganism.

The incubator chamber kept the test at a constant temperature of 25 \textdegree C in the dark, measurements were routinely checked every day until the end of the 30-day period. This was done to facilitate early failure detection which could cost much time if not addressed on time. At the end of the test, reactors were dismantled, next testing materials were recovered for visual inspection. Medium volumes were determined by filling the vessels with water to the previously mentioned marks and pouring the amount into a graduated cylinder. Eventually, data could be extracted using vendor-provided software into individual spreadsheet files for each test. For tidiness, a unified comma-separated values (CSV) file was assembled following tidy practices suggested by @hadley2025.

## Models for ultimate biodegradability

As pointed out by @sullivan2010, BOD data has historically been fit to a single exponential model (SEM) defined by @eq-single-exp where $BOD_t$ is biological oxygen demand at any time (mg of O~2~ L^-1^), $BOD_u$ is the ultimate BOD (mg of O~2~ L^-1^) which corresponds to the horizontal asymptote, and $k$ is the first-order biodegradation rate (days^-1^).

$$
BOD_t=BOD_u\ (1-e^{-kt})
$$ {#eq-single-exp}

However, it has long been recognized that SEM does not accurately fit BOD curves [@hewitt1975]. Alternatively, a double exponential model (DEM) offers a more robust approach to biodegradation kinetics [@mason2006] because it considers both labile and refractory components degradation at different rates. This more complex relation is established in @eq-double-exp where $BOD_{u1}$ and $BOD_{u2}$ correspond to the ultimate BOD of the labile and refractory components, respectively; the same distinction is made for both first-order biodegradation rates $k_1$ and $k_2$.

$$
BOD_t=BOD_{u1}(1-e^{-k_1t})+BOD_{u2}(1-e^{-k_2t})
$$ {#eq-double-exp}

Non-linear models were fitted using the R package `nls.multstart` version 2.0.0 developed openly by @padfield2025. This package allows for multiple start parameters and automatically selects the best fitting option. Computations were carried out using a conventional laptop computer which took less than 60 seconds of processing time.
